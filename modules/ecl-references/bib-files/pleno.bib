	abstract = {Recently, the JPEG standardization commit- tee created an initiative called JPEG Pleno. “Pleno” is a reference to “plenoptic,” a mathe- matical representation that not only provides information about any point within a scene but also about how it changes when observed from different positions. “Pleno” is also the Latin word for “complete,” a reference to the JPEG committee’s desire for future imaging to pro- vide a more complete description of scenes, well beyond what’s possible today. Here, we dis- cuss the rationale behind the vision for the JPEG Pleno initiative and describe how it canpotentially reinvent the future of imaging.},
